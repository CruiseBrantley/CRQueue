# CRQueue

View your Crunchyroll queue from any tab

CRQueue is an extension designed to allow you to view your Crunchyroll queue
from any tab and tell at a glance if you have any new episodes to watch.
Once you find an episode you like with the vibrant UI you're linked straight there.
Development is still very early so I would love to hear any features or changes you would like to see made!
